To generate a Northwind Database in MySQL:
-Install the MySQL app (stick with default settings, and configure as a development machine):
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
  -This includes both the MySQL Workbench and MySQL Server applications

-Use this link to download the Northwind script https://www.aspsnippets.com/Articles/Download-and-Install-Microsoft-Northwind-Sample-database-in-MySql.aspx
(select Northwind.MySQL5.sql)
-open script in a text editor, copy the contents to the MySQL instance and execute
-There's a small SQL syntax error on line 4601, the line GROUP BY City WITH ROLLUP;
to fix it just remove WITH ROLLUP and the script should execute fully
-You may get a syntax error about the block comments on starting on line 1. If this occurs simply remove them.

-To verify the database has built, open a new tab for querying and run:
USE northwind;

SHOW tables;
SHOW columns FROM employees;

(Should generate two tables as results, with all database tables
listed in the first and each employee entry columns in the second)
